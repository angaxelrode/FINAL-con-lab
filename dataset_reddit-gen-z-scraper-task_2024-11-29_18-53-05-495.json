Like late teens and twenty something guys tend to have a high sex drive. I remember being 18 and  Googling \"why can't I stop thinking about sex?\" And Google was like \"because you're 18...\" \n\nAs a guy you kinda get use to just being horny, and taking care of yourself. In a relationship, if there's mismatch of libidos, usually it's on the guy to deal with it, and take care of it himself. (Which is good. No one is obligated sex)\n\nIt's gets tough, because it seems like when as a woman ages, her libido tends to increase. So late 30's early 40's you can have the dynamic flip. The woman can be horny looking for relief and the guy can be less enthusiastic. (In r/deadbedrooms both men and woman post)\n\nI think when i reflect on \"how should a partner show up for his woman when her libido has spiked higher than his?\" I tend to feel he should be compassionate.  Like he shouldn't feel obligated (no one should), and at the same time if he made it a fun activity between them, he could be there for her, and it could really deepen their bond. \n\nAnd if this is how a guy should show up for his partner when he has a lower libido, how should a woman show up for her partner if she has a lower libido? \n\nIt's tough, because woman do get pressured into sex, so saying \"what if yall just sheduled sex twice a week?\" Or \"what do we need to do to make this work for both of us?\" Can be interpreted as saying \"woman, just sleep with your guy.\" Which isn't what I want to say. \n\nI do think folks should be eager to have sex with their partner, but not because they feel it's an obligation but because they've created a relationship where it serves both of them. (Guys be eager to make your lady quiver, woman be eager to give him butterflies) \n\nSo be eager, but only if that's your thing.",

They are pretty easy to make, and it only takes about 20min. sometimes I add sausage or bacon to the pan after making them. The smell of fresh pancakes mixes with the sweet savory smell of the bacon/sausage. I'll make breakfast while my girlfriend is waking up, and eventually she'll walk out to the kitchen, with bed-head and some boy shorts, it's 10/10. Having breakfast and a cup of coffee with a beautiful woman leaning against you, feels so good.\n\nbut this experience isn't instead of sex. In fact as the conversation picks up and joking and flirting starts, part of me wants to put the dishes in the sink, then carry her back to the bedroom. Get us naked, and have fun that requires a quick shower afterwards. (This isn't everyday thing. I read somewhere that of folks who have sex 2-3 times a week 90% of them say they are satisfied with their sex life. When this dropped to once a week, only 50% of folks felt satisfied. This tracks for me, but I realize this isn't the case for everyone)\n\nSo for me sex in a relationship is just another aspect of that connection, the connection doesn't replace sex, or sex that connection.\n\nThere is a type of relationship where that isn't the case. Where that emotional connection of tiny beautiful moments with, along with protection and love is there, without a sexual dynamic.\n\nIt's called \"a father\".\n\nI think dads provide that space of masculine unconditional love. where you can be your complete feminine self with no expectations. provided for, and safe. (Ideally, I know for a lot of folks this isn't the case)\n\nUnfortunately I think life calls us away from that safety. I want to be someone's lover, and romantic partner. I want to provide a space to see and be seen, to develop into the person I want to be (currently vibing with David Bowie's energy. Don't know if I'm gonna get there, but i'll cross that bridge when I get to it.), not a parental figure. which is tough, because sometimes folks just need to be baby.\n\nEdit: I will say sexual stuff does turn off bad emotions. So sometimes guys, instead of experiencing/going through normal negative feelings in life, will watch porn or engage in sex as a way of avoidance. So that's a things.",
